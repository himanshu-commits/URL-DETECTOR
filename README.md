## Introduction

The **URL Classification Project** is a powerful tool that can identify and classify URLs as either safe or malicious, providing you with a safer online experience. Our Python-based solution combines cutting-edge machine learning algorithms with a user-friendly web interface and an accessible API.

## Project Overview

We've got you covered from all angles:

- **Machine Learning Model:** Our machine learning model classifies URLs using an extensive set of features and rigorous training.

- **User-Friendly Web Interface:** Easily classify URLs with a sleek web interface. Input a URL, and our model will do the rest!

- **Versatile API:** For developers, we've exposed a simple API that allows you to integrate URL classification into your applications.

## Getting Started

Don't worry; it's easy to get started with our project. Here's how:

### Prerequisites

Before you dive in, ensure you have the following:

- Python 3.x
- The required Python packages (listed in `requirements.txt`)

### Installation

1. Start by cloning the repository:

   ```shell
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/url-classification.git
   cd url-classification
   ```

2. Create a virtual environment and install the necessary dependencies:

   ```shell
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

Once you're all set up, you can put our project to work.

### Training the Model

Are you interested in training our model further? Find detailed instructions in our `train_model.ipynb` Jupyter notebook.

### Web Interface

For an intuitive URL classification experience, run the `app.py` file. Then, simply visit `http://localhost:5000` in your web browser and start classifying URLs.

### API Usage

If you're a developer, you can use our API to classify URLs in your applications. Make POST requests to the `/classify` endpoint with JSON data in this format:

```json
{
  "link": "google.com",
  "source": "your_ip_address"
}
```

The API will respond with a JSON object:

```json
{
  "link": "google.com",
  "source": "your_ip_address",
  "result": "safe",
  "confidence": 0.9
}
```

## Project Structure

Our project is organized for simplicity and flexibility. Here's an overview of the main directories and files:

- `app.py`: The main file for the web interface and API.
- `train_model.ipynb`: A Jupyter notebook for model training.
- `templates`: Contains HTML templates for the web interface.
- `myclass.py`: The core script containing model training and classification functions.
- `requirements.txt`: Lists the required Python packages.
